Analyses of reading times 

In this project I analyzed reading times from a self-paced reading experiment.

This experiment investigated the real time comprehension of Brazilian Portuguese sentences with Optionally transitive verbs (OPT) and Obligatorily transitive verbs (OT) with implicit direct objects.

The hypothesis predicted that sentences with OT verbs and no previous available antecedent (no antec condition) would lead to comprehension difficulties, as seen in slower reading times at the critical region. 

This study is part of Ana Besserman's PhD dissertation in Linguistics at USC: for more details please contact the author at pianibes@usc.edu or check out a presentation of this study at https://osf.io/52zbj/.

Here you will find an R script in which I cleaned and prepared data for analysis, built data visualization of word-by-word reading times with ggplot, and ran statistical analyses of reading times differences with mixed linear models (lmer).

Feel free to use and adapt the R script.
